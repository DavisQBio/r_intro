#### Primary Contributors

Course materials have been modified by Robert Furrow, based on the Data Carpentry 
course [R for Data Analysis and Visualization of Ecological Data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/). The site's style and structure are modified 
from the [Data Carpentry for Biologists](http://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology).
Here are links to the details on the [contributers to R for Data Analysis and Visulization of Ecological Data](http://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/CITATION) and the 
[contributers to Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/graphs/contributors) (primarily [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) and [Zachary Brym](http://zackbrym.weecology.org/)).


#### Infrastructure

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) 
and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy.
