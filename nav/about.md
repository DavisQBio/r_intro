#### The Point

These lessons are resources to support student learning of the programming language R, with a focus on quantitative topics in biology. The materials cover topics in ecology and bioinformatics, and can be used either as flipped classroom material or as a component of hands-on computational lab sessions or workshops. 


#### Primary Contributors

Course materials have been modified or created by Robert Furrow.  The explorations are designed
by Robert Furrow with input from Joel Rodriguez-Medina, Hyunsoo Gloria Kim, Alex Nord, Marc Facciotti, and John Albeck.  Any explorations primarily designed by collaborators are indicated on the individual page. The readings are based on the Data Carpentry 
course [R for Data Analysis and Visualization of Ecological Data](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/). The site's style and structure are modified 
from [Data Carpentry for Biologists](http://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology).
Here are links to the details on the [contributers to R for Data Analysis and Visulization of Ecological Data](http://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/CITATION) and the
