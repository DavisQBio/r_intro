-   Weâ€™ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or
    double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix
    these types in a single vector? Try it out.
    -   *R implicitly converts them all to be the same type.*
-   What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to
    check the data type of your objects).

    ``` {.r}
    num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
    num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
    char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
    tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
    ```

-   Why do you think it happens?
    -   *Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert
        (coerce) the content of this vector to find a "common
        denominator" that doesn't lose any information.*
-   How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character)
    in the following example:

    ``` {.r}
    num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
    char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
    combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
    ```

    -   *Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the
        coercion happens the first time the vector is evaluated.
        Therefore, the `TRUE` in `num_logical` gets converted into a `1`
        before it gets converted into `"1"` in `combined_logical`.*
