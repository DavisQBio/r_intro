> 1.  We have seen how data frames are created when using `read.csv()`,
>     but they can also be created by hand with the `data.frame()`
>     function. There are a few mistakes in this hand-crafted
>     `data.frame`. Can you spot and fix them? Don't hesitate to

> 2.  Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following

>     `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when creating the data frame?
> -   What would you need to change to ensure that each column had the
>     accurate data type?

> `r   country_climate <- data.frame(       country = c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),       climate = c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),       temperature = c(10, 30, 18, "15"),       northern_hemisphere = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, "FALSE"),       has_kangaroo = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 1)       )`
> Answers: \* missing quotations around the names of the animals, \*
> missing one entry in the "feel" column (probably for one of the furry
> animals), \* missing one comma in the weight column, \* `country`,
> `climate`, `temperature`, and `northern_hemisphere` are factors;
> `has_kangaroo` is numeric, \* using `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` would
> have made them character instead of factors, \* removing the quotes in
> temperature and northern\_hemisphere and replacing 1 by TRUE in the
> `has_kangaroo` column would give what was probably intended.
