 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector with the NAs removed.
    ```{r}
    heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
    ```

 2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.

 3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.


```{r}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

# 1.

heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)] 
# or
heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)

# 2.

 median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

# 3.

heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
length(heights_above_67)
```
