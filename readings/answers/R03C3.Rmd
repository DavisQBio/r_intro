> ### Challenge
>
> 1. How many animals were caught in each `plot_type` surveyed?
>
> ```{r,eval=FALSE}
> surveys %>%
>     count(plot_type) 
> ```
>
> 2. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot
> length for each species (using `species_id`). Also add the number of
> observations (hint: see `?n`).
>
> ```{r,eval=FALSE}
> surveys %>%
>     filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
>     group_by(species_id) %>%
>     summarize(
>         mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length),
>         min_hindfoot_length = min(hindfoot_length),
>         max_hindfoot_length = max(hindfoot_length),
>         n = n()
>     )
> ```
>
> 3. What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns `year`,
> `genus`, `species_id`, and `weight`.
>
> ```{r,eval=FALSE}
> surveys %>%
>     filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
>     group_by(year) %>%
>     filter(weight == max(weight)) %>%
>     select(year, genus, species, weight) %>%
>     arrange(year)
> ```
