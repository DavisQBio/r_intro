> ### Challenge
>
> * Rename "F" and "M" to "female" and "male" respectively.
> * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "undetermined", 
>   can you recreate the barplot such that 
>   "undetermined" is last (after "male")?

```{r}
levels(sex)[2:3] <- c("female", "male")
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "undetermined"))
plot(sex)
```
