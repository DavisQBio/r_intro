> ### Challenge
>
> Create a new data frame from the `surveys` data that meets the
> following criteria: contains only the `species_id` column and a new
> column called `hindfoot_half` containing values that are half the
> `hindfoot_length` values. In this `hindfoot_half` column, there are no
> `NA`s and all values are less than 30.

``` {.r}
surveys_hindfoot_half <- surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length / 2) %>%
    filter(hindfoot_half < 30) %>%
    select(species_id, hindfoot_half)
