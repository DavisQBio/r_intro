```{r, echo=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("../data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```
1.  Create a `data.frame` (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in
    row 200 of the `surveys` dataset.

2.  Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?
        * Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
        * Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
        sure it's meeting expectations.
        * Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
        * Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

3.  Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data
    frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

4.  Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
    `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys
    dataset.
